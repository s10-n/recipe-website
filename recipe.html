      <p>We usually think of fried chicken traditionally as an American dish, but today I'm going to share with you an old English recipe from a little recipe book by Nathan Bailey called "Dictionarium Domesticum" written in 1736 that I think will change the way you make fried chicken. It's set up like a dictionary so it’s in alphabetical order and you’ll find this recipe under marinade.</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>In the 18th century, they would most likely have used lard or even a clarified butter. You can use the modern oil of your choice. Be very careful if you are deep frying over an open fire. You want to heat your oil to about 350 degrees. You should see a little shimmer on the top, but definitely not smoking.

<h2>Directions <a class="up_arrow" href="#siteheader">[^]</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>The recipe calls for quartering your chicken. I’ve actually cut it up into individual pieces so that it’ll go a little farther. The recipe suggests marinating this chicken for 3 hours and you should probably stick to that. Some of the more powerful ingredients, like the malt vinegar, can really enhance the flavor too much if you marinate for too long.</li>
<li>Once you come to the 3-hour mark, it’s time to work on the batter portion. Like our marinade, the batter is also very easy to make. I’m using about a cup and a half of flour, just regular all-purpose flour will work fine. Add enough white wine, like Rhine wine would be good, to make this into a thin pancake batter. If you don’t want to use wine, you could use cider instead or maybe just water.</li>
<li>Finally, add the yolks of 3 eggs and a teaspoon of salt. You can top this off with a little more wine if needed to get the right batter consistency.</li>
<li>You want to heat your oil to about 350 degrees. You should see a little shimmer on the top, but definitely not smoking.</li>
<li>We’re going to fry this in batches of 3 or 4, maybe 5 pieces, depending on the size of your pot. I’m not sure exactly how long you want to cook it, but you want to get to the point where the color is a nice light mahogany brown.</li>
<li>Now before we serve this, there’s just one more component that we need to do, fried parsley. Now you may think that’s strange, but trust me, you’ll love it. Before you fry your parsley, make sure it is very, very dry. Blot it as much as possible, or the results can be disastrous. Fry it in small batches for several minutes until it gets nice and crispy. We’ll crumble this over the chicken as a tasty garnish.</li>
